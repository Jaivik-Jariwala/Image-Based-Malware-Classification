# Malware Classification using U-Net and Classifier

Welcome to the Malware Classification project repository! In this project, we aim to classify malware images using the U-Net architecture and a Classifier algorithm. We use the Maling and Malang datasets for training and evaluation. Additionally, we compare the performance of our approach with other algorithms.

## Project Overview
Malware classification is a crucial task in cybersecurity. This project focuses on automating the classification of malware images into different categories using deep learning techniques. We utilize the U-Net architecture for feature extraction and a Classifier algorithm for final classification.

## Datasets
We use two datasets for this project:
- **Maling Dataset:** This dataset contains labeled images of various types of malware.
- **Malang Dataset:** A complementary dataset that includes additional samples for malware classification.

You can find the datasets in the `data/` directory. Please ensure you have the datasets before running the code.

## Approach
Our approach involves two main steps:
1. **Feature Extraction using U-Net:** We use the U-Net architecture to extract meaningful features from malware images. The U-Net model is trained on the Maling and Malang datasets to learn features specific to malware.

2. **Classification:** After feature extraction, we pass the extracted features through a Classifier algorithm. This step assigns a specific category to the malware image.
