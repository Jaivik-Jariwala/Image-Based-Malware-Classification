Data Overview: EDA begins with loading and examining the dataset. This includes checking the structure of the data (number of rows and columns), data types, and basic summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.\n\n2. Data Visualization: Creating various visual representations such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and density plots to visualize the distribution of data, relationships between variables, and potential outliers.\n\n3. Missing Data: Identifying missing values in the dataset and deciding how to handle them, such as imputing missing values or excluding them.\n\n4. Feature Analysis: Analyzing individual features (columns) to understand their characteristics and distributions. This can involve examining categorical values, unique values, and their frequency.\n\n5. Correlation Analysis: Investigating correlations between numerical variables to understand how they interact with each other. Correlation matrices and heatmaps are commonly used for this purpose.\n\n6. Outlier Detection: Identifying extreme values that are significantly different from the rest of the data. Outliers can provide valuable insights or indicate data quality issues.\n\n7. Data Transformation: Applying data transformations such as normalization, scaling, and encoding categorical variables to make the data suitable for modeling.\n\n8. Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on the existing data to capture additional information that may be useful for modeling.\n\n9. Hypothesis Generation: Formulating initial hypotheses about the relationships between variables based on EDA findings.\n\n10.
